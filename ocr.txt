"Material information" includes any fact which Insurers may reasonably wish to know in relation to their assessment of the risk, the exposure and in calculation of any appropriate premium. You must disclose all such information whether or not a specific question has been included in the application form. You must disclose to the insurer all material circumstances which you know, or ought to know. You "ought to know" information that should reasonably have been revealed by a reasonable search of information available to you. You must therefore undertake a reasonable search of such information (such as by making enquiries, or performing an electronic search).  1 Please use this section to provide any additional detail requested above and to add any further information that you feel will assist an Underwriter in understanding your Firm.  During 2018 and 2019, the firm experienced personnel changes in both the litigation and private client departments as well as the Brexit effect on Conveyancing, all which conspired to significantly affected fee income across 3 major areas. Prior to lockdown in March 2020, fee income had returned to levels which would have achieved annual Billing in the region of £1.6 m added to which further cost saving measures were also put in place to increase net profits. Other staff changes have also resulted in further savings in relation to the annual wage bill and reorganisation of existing personnel will mean no additional fee earning staff will need to be taken on. Building upon the above, the firm has now repaid the long term loan made by Lamb and Holmes Friendly Society as well as retaining sufficient funds each month to enable last years CBIL to be repaid in full after 9 months should the firm choose so to do The firms offices remained open throughout lockdown with minimal remote working. All staff have been back in the office since the beginning of 2021 In addition to the finding against the firm by the Ombudsman in relation to post completion conduct/communication, one other matter was also referred in which instance the clients complaints were not upheld.  2 If there has been any significant change in your Firm in the last year, or you expect any significant change in the coming year, please provide details here.
