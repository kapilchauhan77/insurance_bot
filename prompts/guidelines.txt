General Approach & Scope:

The guide aims to provide a consistent method for assessing risk in Solicitors Professional Indemnity insurance to achieve underwriting profitability.   
Insurers must provide cover according to the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) minimum terms.   
Income assessment depends on the firm's size (partner numbers) and the type of work undertaken.   
Inperio generally avoids underwriting sole traders without other qualified staff and large regional firms due to lower rates and potential loss frequency.   
The maximum number of partners should generally not exceed 8, and sole practitioners must be established for at least 3 years.   
Successor Practice:

The definition is complex under SRA terms; a firm can become a successor even unintentionally.   
Succession can occur through various means, including holding out as a successor or taking on principals from a ceased practice.   
If succession occurred within the last 5 years, claims and work details of the predecessor practice are needed for rating.   
Work Risk Categorization:

High Risk Work: Requires significant review due to high frequency and/or severity potential. Includes:
Commercial work for Public Companies (severity risk).   
Commercial Conveyancing (frequency risk; decline/refer if >6 claims in 6 years).   
Residential Conveyancing (frequency risk, consider mortgage fraud propensity; decline/refer if >6 claims in 6 years).   
Financial advice regulated by SRA/FCA (specialized, complex claims; refer to R&Q).   
Intellectual Property (highly specialized, large claims potential; refer to R&Q).   
  
Medium High Risk Work: Requires caution and assessment on merit. Includes:
Corporate Commercial work (non-public companies).   
Commercial Litigation (severity issues; decline/refer if >50% of fees).   
Personal Injury Claimant (especially multi-track cases >£15,000 and clinical negligence/group litigation).   
Landlord and Tenant (high frequency; check claims history).   
  
Medium Risk Work: Potential frequency issues, values often >£20,000. Includes Defendant Litigious/PI, Employment Contentious, Matrimonial, Probate/Estate Admin, Wills/Trust/Tax Planning. "Other" work exceeding 15% requires explanation or should be declined.   
Low Risk Work: Highly desirable work. Includes Administering Oaths, Agency Advocacy, Arbitration/Adjudication/Mediation, Children/Mental Health/Welfare, Criminal Law, Debt Collection (undisputed), Employment (non-contentious), Expert Witness, Immigration, Lecturing, Offices/Appointments (specific types), Parliamentary Agency, Town/Country Planning.   
Risk Management:

Firms must have a formal risk management strategy.   
Lexcel accreditation is highly valued, especially if held for 3+ years, indicating high management and client care standards. However, continued claims frequency despite Lexcel may indicate issues.   
Other Law Society accreditations (e.g., Conveyancing Quality Scheme, Family Law) are positive indicators.   
ISO9001 is another recognised quality standard.   
Key internal procedures looked for include: complaints/claims handling, business continuity plans, diary systems (especially for time-sensitive work), email guidelines, client vetting, use of retainer letters, risk assessment per instruction, conflict checks, and regular file audits (including partners).
Claims:

Full 6-year claims history (qualifying insurer's printout) is required before quoting.   
Claims ratio calculation involves weighting incurred claims based on recency (Y1=150%, Y2=125%, Y3/Y4=50%, Y5=35%, Y6=20%).   
Business with a loss ratio exceeding 75% requires R&Q consent.   
Underwriting Process & Rating:

Full underwriting requires a completed proposal form, 6-year claims summaries, and any specific requested info.   
Indicative terms can be issued on incomplete info but are non-binding until all info is received and accepted. Binding quotes are typically open for 90 days.   
Rating uses a technical premium based on work splits, adjusted by debits (e.g., increased indemnity limit, single principal loading) and credits (e.g., size discount, claims discount).   
Discretionary discounts (up to 20%) and loadings can be applied.   
Premium is grossed up (max 32.5%) for commission.   
Minimum premium is £4,000 + IPT.   
Standard excess is 0.50% of last year's fees (min £2,500), or 0.275% (min £1,000) for low-risk work only. Maximum excess is generally 2.5% of rateable fees.   
Referral Criteria (to R&Q):

Referrals are needed for risks meeting specific criteria, including:
Fees >£5M average over 3 years.   
Claims Ratio >75%.   
Principals with <3 years PQE.   
Sole Practitioners established <5 years.   
Overseas income >10%.   
Commercial work for public companies or >20% Commercial Litigation.   
Any Financial Services work.   
IP work >£25k fees.   
Specific M&A criteria.   
Financial viability concerns (fees <£40k per partner).   
Significant renewal rate reductions (>15% not due to market changes) or new referral triggers.
